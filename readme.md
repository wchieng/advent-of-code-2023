# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions and experiments related to the Advent of Code 2023 (https://adventofcode.com/2023).
Some solutions are in GDScript, a programming language for developing games and apps in Godot Engine (https://godotengine.org).

# Why GDScript?

I wanted to learn some game dev, so this was a fun way to become more familiar with Godot and GDScript.

# Setup

1. Download Godot Engine (https://godotengine.org) and follow the setup instructions there.
2. Clone this repository and import the project into Godot.
3. In order to run the automation tests, install the GUT add-on (https://github.com/bitwes/Gut).
4. Run the "game" and it'll print out the answers!
